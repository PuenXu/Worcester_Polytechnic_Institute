## Group Challenge

> List the strengths and weaknesses of each of the three "vision" systems. Though you didn't implement navigation or control (yet), discuss how you could use each of the methods to help a robot navigate. Discuss other important performance measures, like reliability, ease-of-use, and so forth. We're looking for evidence that you've thought about how these devices could be used with real robots.

> Create a release of your code that you used to complete the challenge and paste the link here.
